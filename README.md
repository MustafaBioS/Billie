**<h1>Notes</h1>**
**I still need to make some improvements to this but unfortunately i couldn't as i had exams and was super busy,
i need to finish up the logging out functionality and to add a better profile page other than that div that appears
and dissappears, i also need to fix up the songs as i added all the albums' songs as the HMHAS songs,
I also need to add functionality for the search bar.**
